 I am an Assistant Professor of Environmental Policy at the University of Georgia's Odum School of Ecology and Policy Director of the River Basin Center. I study the political economy of climate adaptation and environmental governance. In agricultural and energy systems across South Asia, Europe, and the United States, I examine how social inequality and policy disparities shape climate adaptation. I am particularly interested in how policy and household decisions impact adaptation outcomes across scales.
 
 â€‹Interdisciplinarity, collaborative work, and a multi-method approach, are central to my research. Trained in sustainability science, my research often draws on economics, political science, and human geography. My quantitative methodological toolkit includes econometrics, game theory, coupled human-natural systems modeling, behavioral experiments, and computational text analysis. I work closely with diverse social scientists, ecologists, engineers, and policy scholars. This integrative approach is critical for tackling complex issues of adaptation and equity that lie beyond the scope of any single methodology or discipline.
